# Scullery Disarray

This is a personal Unity project that is being made by following Code Monkey's [Learn Unity Beginner/Intermediate 2025 (FREE COMPLETE Course - Unity Tutorial)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmGSEH7QcDg&list=PLzDRvYVwl53uAyV0SjL_3d_IoRDiybAdN&index=3&t=12308s) tutorial course.

By following this course, I should be able to learn proper game development with clean and professional coding structure and project management. This should also serve as my personal documentation, should I forget some Unity C# concepts.

## Notes
⚠️ [09/25/25] As of publishing this repository, I still haven't finished the entire course; but once I finish it, I would like to redo the entire project and put my whole spin on it.
